Kemo IPTV typically offers a money-back guarantee to ensure customer satisfaction. The specifics can vary based on the terms and conditions set by the provider, but it generally involves a short period after purchase where users can request a refund if they are not satisfied with the service. This allows new users to try the service risk-free, providing peace of mind before committing to a longer subscription term.
